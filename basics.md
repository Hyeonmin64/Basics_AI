### Cybenko theorem (easy ver)

<https://www.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/fileadmin/10040900/2019/Seminar__Artificial_Neural_Network__24_9__.pdf>

- Universal approximation theorem for shallow network.
- Here, it proves the setting with single layer and at most 2-dimensional input, and 1-dimensional output. (If all the parameters are single, then its formula can be written in simple expression)
- It does not give the formal approach, just explanation of cybenko theorem. so even high-school student can understand this.
